## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Remove Spaces"

### Objectives

- Remove all spaces from a string (`str`).
- The output should return a new string, with no spaces.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Get hacking on the problem, test when you think you've got it, and open a PR when it's done!

### Notes

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
